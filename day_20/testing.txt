[4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11]

Move the 2s

Sequential OK?

[4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11]
[4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11]

What about crossing?

[5, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
indices = [0, 3]

Move the first
[1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
Breaks since index has changed!

Need to move in sync, or detect crossing? Corner-case is that you can even cross in sync. Can assume that no two duplicates are next to each other?
